Package: vulkan-validationlayers
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libvulkan1 (>= 1.2.182.0~rc1)
Description: Vulkan is an Explicit API, enabling direct control over how GPUs actually
 work. By design, minimal error checking is done inside a Vulkan driver. Applications
 have full control and responsibility for correct operation. Any errors in how Vulkan
 is used can result in a crash. This project provides Vulkan validation layers that
 can be enabled to assist development by enabling developers to verify their
 applications' correct use of the Vulkan API.
